They have thick, fleshy, deeply colored root, which grows underground, and feathery green leaves that emerge above the ground.

Fresho brings you the flavour and richness of the finest bright orange, crispy and juicy carrots.",

Alternatively to retain freshness and for more longevity, trim off the greens and put whole carrots in a container of water and refrigerate. With this method, they stay nice and crunchy. If the water starts to look cloudy, change it with fresh water. Stored this way, carrots can last for even a month with no ill effects and dont wilt easily.",
